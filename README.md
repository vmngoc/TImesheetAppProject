# Working Time Tracker Android App
-- Providing a hassle-free and organized way to keep track of a person’s working time -- <br />

- Target audience: a freelancer whose schedule is not very consistent and the freelancer also often works on multiple projects at a time and it’s hard to keep track of those projects separately.  The app can also be extended to serve companies where employees and employers are busy and don’t want to spend so much time on the boring task of filling out timesheets and checking them manually. <br />
- My solution: a mobile app that helps users storing time entries and produce meaningful reports so that users stay up-to-date with their current work hours and earnings. <br />
- Technologies that I use: Android, PHP, MySQL, SQLite <br />
